<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seatbelts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-point Safety Belts</li><li>3-point Safety Belts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The seatbelt market can be categorized into two main types: 2-point and 3-point safety belts. </p><p>2-point safety belts, often seen in older vehicles and some utility equipment, consist of two attachment points, securing the occupant at the waist. In contrast, 3-point safety belts provide enhanced protection by securing the occupant at three points—across the shoulder and lap—making them the standard in most modern vehicles. This added support minimizes injury risk during collisions, making 3-point belts the preferred choice for safety.</p></p>
