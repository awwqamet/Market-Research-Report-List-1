<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Centrifugal Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forward-curved</li><li>Backward-curved</li><li>Straight Radial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC centrifugal fans are categorized into three main types based on their blade designs: forward-curved, backward-curved, and straight radial. Forward-curved fans have blades that curve in the direction of the airflow, making them ideal for high-volume, low-pressure applications. Backward-curved fans, with blades curving against the airflow, offer high efficiency and are suitable for high-pressure systems. Straight radial fans have blades that extend perpendicular to the airflow, providing robust performance in heavy-duty applications, often handling dust and particulates effectively.</p></p>
