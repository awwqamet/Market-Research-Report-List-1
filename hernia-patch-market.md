<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hernia Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hernia patch market is divided into two primary types: absorbable and non-absorbable patches. Absorbable patches are designed to gradually dissolve and be absorbed by the body over time, which minimizes long-term foreign material presence but may necessitate additional support during healing. Non-absorbable patches, made from synthetic materials, provide permanent reinforcement and are highly durable, ensuring long-term stability. Each type has specific applications based on the hernia’s nature and the patient’s condition, influencing surgeon preferences and clinical outcomes.</p></p>
