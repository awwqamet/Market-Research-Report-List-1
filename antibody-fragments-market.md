<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antibody Fragments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>F(ab) Fragment</li><li>F(ab’)2 Fragment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antibody fragments market comprises various types, including F(ab) fragments and F(ab’)2 fragments, which are vital in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. F(ab) fragments consist of the Fab regions of antibodies but lack the Fc region, enhancing tissue penetration and reducing immune responses. In contrast, F(ab’)2 fragments are dimeric forms derived from antibody digestion, maintaining cross-linking capabilities while minimizing Fc-mediated effects. Both fragment types are leveraged for targeted therapies, enabling precision in treating diseases like cancer and autoimmune disorders.</p></p>
